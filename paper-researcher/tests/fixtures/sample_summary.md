## Problem
This paper addresses the challenge of building reliable LLM-based agent systems that can handle complex multi-step tasks requiring planning and tool use.

## Method
The authors propose a hierarchical agent framework that separates planning, execution, and reflection phases. The system uses a tree-structured approach to explore multiple solution paths and incorporates self-correction mechanisms.

## Results
The framework achieves 45% improvement over baseline on the ALFWorld benchmark. Human evaluation shows 3.2x higher task completion rate compared to single-step prompting approaches.

## Takeaways
- Hierarchical decomposition significantly improves complex task handling
- Reflection phases are critical for error recovery and learning
- The framework is model-agnostic and works with various LLM backends
- Planning before execution leads to more reliable outcomes
